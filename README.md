> Supplementary documentation and example data for the FCSlib package are available here.

> Example data sets are "Cy5_100nM.tif", "V2.tif", "V6.tif" & "V2V6.tif". They correspond to real experimental data used to test the functions provided (see "FCSlib_Supp_Mat.PDF" for more details). After downloading them, make sure their location in your drive matches the working directory of your R Scripts.
